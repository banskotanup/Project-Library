# Project-Library
The **Library Project** from *The Odin Project* is a JavaScript-based app where users can add, remove, and track books. It focuses on **objects, constructors/classes, DOM manipulation, and event handling**. Users can mark books as read/unread, store data in local storage, and dynamically update the UI. ðŸš€
